An extension to marshmallow to allow for polymorphic fields

Marshmallow is a fantastic library for serialization and deserialization of data. 
For more on that project see its [GitHub](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow) page or its [Documentation](http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

This project adds a custom field designed for polymorphic types. This allows you to define a schema that says "This field accepts anything of type X"
