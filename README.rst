This branch supports Marshmallow 2.0. For 3.0 support see `The master branch <https://github.com/Bachmann1234/marshmallow-polyfield/tree/master>`_

An unofficial extension to Marshmallow to allow for polymorphic fields.

Marshmallow is a fantastic library for serialization and deserialization of data.
For more on that project see its `GitHub <https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow>`_ page or its `Documentation <http://marshmallow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

This project adds a custom field designed for polymorphic types. This allows you to define a schema that says "This field accepts anything of type X"

The secret to this field is that you need to define two functions. One to be used when serializing, and another for deserializing. These functions
take in the raw value and return the schema to use.

This field should support the same properties as other Marshmallow fields. I have worked with *required* *allow_none* and *many*.

Installing
----------
::

    $ pip install marshmallow-polyfield

Importing
---------
Here is how to import the necessary field class
::

    from marshmallow_polyfield import PolyField

Example
-------

The code below demonstrates how to setup a schema with a PolyField. For the full context check out the tests.
Once setup the schema should act like any other schema. If it does not then please file an Issue.

        try:
            return class_to_schema[base_object.__class__.__name__]()
        except KeyError:
            pass

        raise TypeError("Could not detect type. "
                        "Did not have a base or a length. "
